# TJCTF Problems

Upload your problems as markdown files. Each problem gets its own directory

Name the your problem file the same as its containing directory. Put the resources that your problem needs in that directory.

Answer the problem with a file called answer in the project directory. Put a json file with your author information called meta.json in the directory as well.

We will have the ability for people to write "graders" for their problems that may not have one unique correct answer.
