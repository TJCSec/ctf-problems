#Into the Galli-frey

Oh no! Something has happened and we are locked out of the TARDIS. The Doctor sent us a message telling us the password to get in, but he wrote it in Gallifreyan and the TARDIS won't translate until we open her up. Use you deciphering skills to figure out a way in. 

(HINT)
Start at 0deg and go clockwise
