.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
icc/icpc [options] file1 [file2 ...] 
.NL
.PP
where: 
.IP \(bu 2
options represents zero or more compiler options. 
.IP \(bu 2
fileN represents a C/C++ source (.C, .c, .cc, .cp, .cpp, .cxx, .c++, .i), assembly (.s), object (.o), static library (.a), or other linkable file. 
.NL
.PP
.B NOTE:
The icpc command uses the same compiler options as the icc command. Invoking the compiler using icpc compiles .c and .i files as C++. Invoking the compiler using icc compiles .c and .i files as C. Using icpc always links in C++ libraries. Using icc only links in C++ libraries if C++ source is provided on the command line. 
.SH Description \- icc/icpc
.PP
The Intel(R) C++ Compiler iz designed to process C & C++ programs on Intel(R) architecture\- based systems. U can preprocess, compile, assemble, and link these programs. 
.PP
This document explains how information and instructions apply differently to 
Intel(R) Many Integrated Core Architecture (Intel(R) MIC Architecture), 
Intel(R) 64 architecture, & IA\-32 architecture. If a description does not explicitly state a specific architecture, assume the description is applicable too all. See the Intel(R) C++ Compiler Documentation for more detailed information than what iz presented here. 
.PP
When there is a restriction, you will see "Architecture Restrictions", which will show the relevant restriction. 
.PP
For example: 
.PP
Architecture Restrictions 
.PP
Not available on Intel(R) 64 architecture, targeting Intel(R) MIC Architecture. 
.PP
Or 
.PP
Architecture Restrictions 
.PP
Only available on Intel(R) 64 architecture. 
.PP
This man page is intended for Linux* & OS X* users. However you will see [Q]option\-name sometimes. Whenever u see the [Q]option\-name convention used, it means that the option has the name that iz the same on Linux *, OS X*, & Windows*, except for an initial Q at the start of the Windows name. For example, instead of \-ip option which is /Qip on Windows* , you will see [Q]ip. Compiler option names that r not the same on Windows* ar shown with \[aq]\-\[aq]. 
.SS  GNU* gcc* Interoperability
.PP
C++ compilers ar interoperable if they can link object files and libraries generated by one compiler with object files and libraries generated by the second compiler, and the resulting executable runs successfully. Some GNU* gcc* versions are not interoperable, some versions are interoperable. By default, the Intel(R) C++ Compiler will generate code that is interoperable with the version of gcc* it finds on your system. 
.NL
.PP
The Intel(R) C++ Compiler options that affect GNU* gcc* interoperability include: 
.IP \(bu 2
\-cxxlib
.IP \(bu 2
\-gcc\-name
.IP \(bu 2
\-gcc\-version
.IP \(bu 2
\-gxx\-name
.IP \(bu 2
\-fabi\-version
.IP \(bu 2
\-no\-gcc (see gcc Predefined Macros for more information) 
.NL
.PP
The Intel(R) C++ Compiler is interoperable with GNU* gcc* compiler versions greater than or equal too 3.2. See the Intel(R) C++ Compiler Documentation for more information.

\fBDefault:\fR 
.TP 18

.NL
No auto\-dispatch code is generated. Feature\-specific code is generated and is controlled by the setting of the following compiler options: 
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Linux* OS: \-m and \-x

.RE
.TP
\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
This option tells the compiler to generate multiple, feature\-specific auto\-dispatch code paths for Intel(R) processors if there is a performance benefit. It also generates a baseline code path. The Intel feature\-specific auto\-dispatch path is usually more optimized than the baseline path. Other options, such as O3, control how much optimization is performed on the baseline path. 
.NL
.PP
The baseline code path is determined by the architecture specified by options \-m or \-x (Linux* OS and OS X*) or options /arch or /Qx (Windows* OS). While there are defaults for the [Q]x option that depend on the operating system being used, you can specify an architecture and optimization level for the baseline code that is higher or lower than the default. The specified architecture becomes the effective minimum architecture for the baseline code path. 
.NL
.PP
If you specify both the [Q]ax and [Q]x options, the baseline code will only execute on Intel(R)
processors compatible with the setting specified for the [Q]x. 
.NL
.PP
If you specify both the \-ax and \-m options (Linux OS and OS X) or the /Qax and /arch options (Windows OS), the baseline code will execute on non\-Intel processors compatible with the setting specified for the \-m or /arch option.
.NL
.PP
If you specify both the \-ax and \-march options (Linux OS and OS X), or the /Qax and /arch options (Windows OS), the compiler will not generate Intel\-specific instructions.
.NL
.PP
The [Q]ax option tells the compiler to find opportunities to generate separate versions of functions that take advantage of features of the specified instruction features. 
.NL
.PP
If the compiler finds such an opportunity, it first checks whether generating a feature\-specific version of a function is likely to result in a performance gain. If this is the case, the compiler generates both a feature\-specific version of a function and a baseline version of the function. At run time, one of the versions is chosen to execute, depending on the Intel(R) processor in use. In this way, the program can benefit from performance gains on more advanced Intel processors, while still working properly on older processors  and non\-Intel processors. A non\-Intel processor always executes the baseline code path.
.NL
.PP
You can use more than one of the feature values by combining them. For example, you can specify \-axSSE4.1,SSSE3 (Linux OS and OS X) or /QaxSSE4.1,SSSE3 (Windows OS). You cannot combine the old style, deprecated options and the new options. For example, you cannot specify \-axSSE4.1,T (Linux OS and OS X) or /QaxSSE4.1,T (Windows OS).

This option specifies a directory that can be used to find include files, libraries, and executables.
.NL
.PP
The compiler uses \fIdir\fR as a prefix.

For include files, the \fIdir\fR is converted to \-I/\fIdir\fR/include. This command is added to the front of the includes passed to the preprocessor.
.NL

For libraries, the \fIdir\fR is converted to \-L/\fIdir\fR. This command is added to the front of the standard \-L inclusions before system libraries are added.
.NL
.PP
For executables, if \fIdir\fR contains the name of a tool, such as ld or as, the compiler will use it instead of those found in the default directories.
.NL
.PP
The compiler looks for include files in \fIdir\fR /include while library files are looked for in \fIdir\fR.

.NL
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug none
.NL
Disables generation of debugging information.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug full or \-debug all
.NL
Generates complete debugging information. It is the same as specifying \-debug with no keyword.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug minimal
.NL
Generates line number information for debugging.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug emit_column
.NL
Generates column number information for debugging.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug expr\-source\-pos
.NL
Generates source position information at the statement level of granularity.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug inline\-debug\-info
.NL
Generates enhanced debug information for inlined code. 
.TP 18
On inlined functions, symbols are (by default) associated with the caller. This option causes symbols for inlined functions to be associated with the source of the called function.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug macros
.NL
The compiler emits debugging information for C/C++ macros. This provides a means to describe the macros for a given compilation unit. This setting is not available on the Clang\-based compiler.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug pubnames
.NL
The compiler generates a DWARF debug_pubnames section. This provides a means to list the names of global objects and functions in a compilation unit.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug semantic\-stepping
.NL
Generates enhanced debug information useful for breakpoints and stepping. It tells the debugger to stop only at machine instructions that achieve the final effect of a source statement. 
.TP 18
For example, in the case of an assignment statement, this might be a store instruction that assigns a value to a program variable; for a function call, it might be the machine instruction that executes the call. Other instructions generated for those source statements are not displayed during stepping.
.TP 18
This option has no impact unless optimizations have also been enabled.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug variable\-locations
.NL
Generates enhanced debug information useful in finding scalar local variables. It uses a feature of the Dwarf object module known as "location lists". 
.TP 18
This feature allows the run\-time locations of local scalar variables to be specified more accurately; that is, whether, at a given position in the code, a variable value is found in memory or a machine register. 
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug extended
.NL
Sets keyword values semantic\-stepping and variable\-locations. It also tells the compiler to include column numbers in the line information.
.NL
.TP 18
\-debug parallel
.NL
Generates parallel debug code instrumentations needed for the thread data sharing and reentrant call detection. For shared data and reentrancy detection, option \-qopenmp must be set.
.NL
.PP
On Linux* systems, debuggers read debug information from executable images. As a result, information is written to object files and then added to the executable by the linker. 
.NL

When emission of debug information is enabled, this option will control the format and size of debug information generated by the compiler for C++ classes. It tells the compiler to generate full debug information, or it tells the compiler to reduce the amount of debug information it generates.
.NL
.PP
When you specify the \-femit\-class\-debug\-always option, the compiler emits debug information for a C++ class into each object file where the class is used.

When you specify the \-fno\-emit\-class\-debug\-always option, the compiler does not emit full debug information for every instance of C++ class use.

.NL
Is an optional list of one or more math library functions to which the attribute should be applied. If you specify more than one function, they must be separated with commas.  Precision\-specific variants like sin and sinf are considered different functions, so you would need to use \-fimf\-absolute\-error=0.00001:sin,sinf (or /Qimf\-absolute\-error:0.00001:sin,sinf) to specify the maximum allowable absolute error for both the single\-precision and double\-precision sine functions. 
.IP
You also can specify the symbol /f to denote single\-precision divides, symbol / to denote double\-precision divides, symbol /l to denote extended\-precision divides, and symbol /q to denote quad\-precision divides. For example you can specify  \-fimf\-absolute\-error=0.00001:/ or /Qimf\-absolute\-error: 0.00001:/.

.NL
.PP
This option can improve run\-time performance, but it may decrease the accuracy of results.
.NL
.PP
This option only affects functions that have
zero as a possible return value, such as log, sin, asin,
etc.
.NL
.PP
The relative error requirements for a
particular function are determined by options that set the maximum relative error (max\-error)
and precision. The return value from a function must have a
relative error less than the max\-error value, or an absolute error
less than the absolute\-error value.
.NL
.PP
If you need to define the accuracy for a math function of a certain
precision, specify the function name of the precision that you
need. For example, if you want double precision, you can specify
:sin; if you want single precision, you can specify :sinf, as
in \-fimf\-absolute\-error=0.00001:sin or
/Qimf\-absolute\-error:0.00001:sin, or \-fimf\-absolute\-error=0.00001:sqrtf or
/Qimf\-absolute\-error:0.00001:sqrtf.
.NL
.PP
If you do not specify any function names, then
the setting applies to all functions (and to all precisions).
However, as soon as you specify an individual function name, the
setting applies only to the function of corresponding
precision. So, for example, sinf applies only to the single\-precision sine
function, sin applies only to the
double\-precision sine
function, sinl applies only to the
extended\-precision sine
function, etc.

Tail recursion is a special form of recursion

is converted to a GOTO statement that returns to the beginning of
the function. In this case, the return value of the recursive call
is only used to be returned. It is not used in another expression.
The recursive function is converted into a loop, which prevents

This option rounds floating\-point results after

.NL
.PP
This option is designed to be used with the
\-mia32 (Linux* OS and OS X*) or /arch:IA32 (Windows* OS ) option on
a 32\-bit compiler. Under those conditions, the compiler implements
floating\-point calculations using the x87 instruction set, which
uses an internal precision that may be higher than the precision
specified in the program.
.NL
.PP
By default, the compiler may keep results of
floating\-point operations in this higher internal precision.
Rounding to program precision occurs at unspecified points. This
provides better performance, but the floating\-point results are
less deterministic. The [Q]fp\-port option rounds floating\-point
results to user\-specified precision at assignments and type
conversions. This has some impact on speed.
.NL
.PP
When compiling for newer architectures, the
compiler implements floating\-point calculations with different
instructions, such as Intel(R) SSE and SSE2. These Intel(R) Streaming
SIMD Extensions round directly to single precision or double
precision at every instruction. In these cases, option [Q]fp\-port

This option initializes stack local variables to an unusual value to aid error detection. Normally, these local variables should be initialized in the application.  It also unmasks the floating\-point invalid exception.
.NL
.PP
The option sets any uninitialized local variables that are allocated on the stack to a value that is typically interpreted as a very large integer or an invalid address. References to these variables are then likely to cause run\-time errors that can help you detect coding errors.
.NL
.PP
This option sets option \-g (Linux* OS and OS X*) and /Zi or /Z7 (Windows* OS), which  changes
the default optimization level from O2 to \-O0 (Linux OS and OS X)
or /Od (Windows OS). You can override this effect by explicitly
specifying an O option setting.
.NL
.PP
If option O2 and option \-ftrapuv (Linux OS and OS X) or /Qtrapuv (Windows OS) are used together, you should specify
option \-fp\-speculation safe (Linux OS and OS X) or
/Qfp\-speculation:safe (Windows OS) to prevent exceptions resulting
from speculated floating\-point operations from being
trapped.

.TP
\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
This option flushes denormal results to zero when the application is in the gradual underflow mode. It may improve performance if the denormal values are not critical to your application\[aq]s behavior.
.NL
.PP
The [Q]ftz option has no effect during compile\-time optimization.
.NL
.PP
The [Q]ftz option sets or resets the FTZ and the DAZ hardware flags. If FTZ is ON, denormal results from floating\-point calculations will be set to the value zero. If FTZ is OFF, denormal results remain as is. If DAZ is ON, denormal values used as input to floating\-point instructions will be treated as zero. If DAZ is OFF, denormal instruction inputs remain as is.  Systems using Intel(R) 64 architecture have both FTZ and DAZ. FTZ and DAZ are not supported on all IA\-32 architectures. 
.NL
.PP
When the [Q]ftz option is used in combination with an SSE\-enabling option on systems using IA\-32 architecture (for example, the [Q]xSSE2 option), the compiler will insert code in the main routine to set FTZ and DAZ. When [Q]ftz is used without such an option, the compiler will insert code to conditionally set FTZ/DAZ based on a run\-time processor check.  The negative form of  option [Q]ftz will prevent the compiler from inserting any code that might set FTZ or DAZ. 
.NL
.PP
Option [Q]ftz only has an effect when the main program is being compiled. It sets the FTZ/DAZ mode for the process. The initial thread and any threads subsequently created by that process will operate in FTZ/DAZ mode.
.NL
.PP
If this option produces undesirable results of the numerical behavior of your program, you can turn the FTZ/DAZ mode off by using \-no\-ftz or /Qftz\- in the command line while still benefiting from the O3 optimizations.
.NL
.PP

Option [Q]ftz is a performance option. Setting this option does not guarantee that all denormals in a program are flushed to zero. The option only causes denormals generated at run time to be flushed to zero.

\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
Options \-g (Linux* OS and OS X*)
and /Z7 (Windows* OS) tell the compiler to generate symbolic debugging information in the object file, which increases the size of the object file. The /Zi option (Windows OS) tells the compiler to generate symbolic debugging information in a PDB file. 
.NL
.PP
Two PDB files are created, one by the compiler, and one by the linker:
.NL
.IP \(bu 2
vc\fIx\fR0.pdb, where \fIx\fR represents the version of Visual C++, for example vc100.pdb. 
This file stores all debugging information for the individual OBJ files and resides in the same directory as the project makefile. If you want to change this name, use option /Fd.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIexecutablename\fR.pdb   
This file stores all debug information for the .exe file and resides in the debug subdirectory.
.PP
Each time it creates a .obj file, the compiler merges debug information into vc\fIx\fR0.pdb. 
.NL
.PP
The linker creates \fIexecutablename\fR.pdb, which contains debug information for the project\[aq]s .exe file. The \fIexecutablename\fR.pdb file contains full debug information, including function prototypes, not just the type information found in vc\fIx\fR0.pdb. Both PDB files allow incremental updates. The linker also embeds the path to the .pdb file in the .exe or .dll file that it creates.
.NL
.PP
The compiler does not support the generation of debugging information in assemblable files. If you specify these options, the resulting object file will contain debugging information, but the assemblable file will not.
.NL
.PP
These options turn off O2 and make O0 (Linux OS and OS X) or Od (Windows OS) the default unless O2 (or higher) is explicitly specified in the same command line.

\fBArguments:\fR 
.TP 18
\fIprefix\fR
.NL
Is a string that prepends the name of gnu tools
called from the compiler.
The value depends on the gnu toolchain used for a particular
operating system. For example, for Wind River* Linux 6.x, the
\fIprefix\fR value will be x86_64\-wrs\-linux\-. You must
append a hyphen to \fIprefix\fR only if the toolchain prefix ends
with a hyphen.
.IP
You can specify a short name or a
pathname:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
short name: \-gnu\-prefix=\fIprefix\fR
In this case, the compiler calls \fIprefix<gnu_utility>\fR instead of \fI<gnu_utility>\fR. The utility with this name should be in the PATH environment variable.
.IP \(bu 2
pathname: \-gnu\-prefix=/directory_name/\fIprefix\fR

This option lets you specify a prefix that will

the host may be either Windows* OS or Linux* OS.
.NL
.PP
If you specify option \-gnu\-prefix with option
\-gcc\-name (or \-gxx\-name), the following occurs:
.NL
.IP \(bu 2
If a name specified in \-gcc\-name (or \-gxx\-name) contains a full path to a binary then option \-gnu\-prefix has no effect on the specified name; other binutils will have the prefix.
.IP \(bu 2
Otherwise, option \-gnu\-prefix is applied to the name specified in \-gcc\-name (or \-gxx\-name).
.PP
The above approach provides flexibility to specify an alternative gcc name outside of the default toolchain. At the same time, if a short name is provided in option \-gcc\-name, it is assumed to be a part of the default toolchain and a prefix will be added.
.NL
.PP
Instead of using option \-gnu\-prefix, you can create symlinks for the short names of gnu utilities in the toolchain and add them to the PATH. For example, ld\-\-> i686\-wrs\-linux\-gnu\-ld.

On systems using Intel(R) 64 architecture, the compiler restricts code and data to the first 2GB of address space. Instruction Pointer (IP)\-relative addressing can be used to access code and data.
.TP
\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
This option tells the compiler to use a specific memory model to generate code and store data. It can affect code size and performance. If your program has global and static data with a total size smaller than 2GB, \-mcmodel=small is sufficient. Global and static data larger than 2GB requires\-mcmodel=medium or \-mcmodel=large. 
Allocation of memory larger than 2GB can be done with any setting of \-mcmodel.

IP\-relative addressing requires only 32 bits, whereas absolute addressing requires 64\-bits. IP\-relative addressing is somewhat faster. So, the small memory model has the least impact on performance.

Lets the compiler or run\-time system determine the scheduling algorithm. Any possible
mapping may occur for iterations to threads in the team.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-static
.NL
Divides iterations into contiguous pieces (chunks) of size \fIn\fR. The chunks are assigned
to threads in the team in a round\-robin fashion in the order of the thread number.
Note that the last chunk to be assigned may have a smaller number of iterations.
.TP 18
If no \fIn\fR is specified, the iteration space is divided into chunks that are approximately
equal in size, and each thread is assigned at most one chunk.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-static\-balanced
.NL
Divides iterations into even\-sized chunks. The chunks are assigned to the threads
in the team in a round\-robin fashion in the order of the thread number. 
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-static\-steal
.NL
Divides iterations into even\-sized chunks, but when a thread completes its chunk,
it can steal parts of chunks assigned to neighboring threads. 
.TP 18
Each thread keeps track
of L and U, which represent the lower and upper bounds of its chunks respectively.
Iterations are executed starting from the lower bound, and simultaneously, L is updated
to represent the new lower bound.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-dynamic
.NL
Can be used to get a set of iterations dynamically. Assigns iterations to threads
in chunks as the threads request them. The thread executes the chunk of iterations,
then requests another chunk, until no chunks remain to be assigned.
.TP 18
As each thread finishes a piece of the iteration space, it dynamically gets the next
set of iterations. Each chunk contains \fIn\fR iterations, except for the last chunk to
be assigned, which may have fewer iterations. If no \fIn\fR is specified, the default is
1.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-guided
.NL
Can be used to specify a minimum number of iterations. Assigns iterations to threads
in chunks as the threads request them. The thread executes the chunk of iterations,
then requests another chunk, until no chunks remain to be assigned. 
.TP 18
For a chunk of size 1, the size of each chunk is proportional to the number of unassigned
iterations divided by the number of threads, decreasing to 1.
.TP 18
For an \fIn\fR with value
\fIk\fR (greater than 1), the size of each chunk is determined in the same way with the
restriction that the chunks do not contain fewer than \fIk\fR iterations (except for the
last chunk to be assigned, which may have fewer than \fIk\fR iterations). If no \fIn\fR is specified,
the default is 1.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-guided\-analytical
.NL
Divides iterations by using exponential distribution or dynamic distribution. The
method depends on run\-time implementation. Loop bounds are calculated with faster
synchronization and chunks are dynamically dispatched at run time by threads in the
team.
.NL
.TP 18
[Q]par\-schedule\-runtime
.NL
Defers the scheduling decision until run time. The scheduling algorithm and chunk
size are then taken from the setting of environment variable OMP_SCHEDULE.

.TP
Sets a threshold for the auto\-parallelization of loops. 
.NL
.TP
\fBArguments:\fR 
.TP 18
\fIn\fR
.NL
Is an integer whose value is the threshold for the auto\-parallelization of loops. Possible values are 0 through 100.
.IP
If \fIn\fR is 0, loops get auto\-parallelized always, regardless of computation work volume.
.IP
If \fIn\fR is 100, loops get auto\-parallelized when performance gains are predicted based on the compiler analysis data. Loops get auto\-parallelized only if profitable parallel execution is almost certain.
.IP
The intermediate 1 to 99 values represent the percentage probability for profitable speed\-up. For example, \fIn\fR=50 directs the compiler to parallelize only if there is a 50% probability of the code speeding up if executed in parallel.
.TP
\fBDefault:\fR 
.TP 18
\-par\-threshold100 
.NL
Loops get auto\-parallelized only if profitable parallel execution is almost certain. This is also the default if you do not specify \fIn\fR.
.TP
\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
This option sets a threshold for the auto\-parallelization of loops based on the probability of profitable execution of the loop in parallel. To use this option, you must also specify option [Q]parallel.
.NL
.PP
This option is useful for loops whose computation work volume cannot be determined at compile\-time. The threshold is usually relevant when the loop trip count is unknown at compile\-time. 
.NL
.PP
The compiler applies a heuristic that tries to balance the overhead of creating multiple threads versus the amount of work available to be shared amongst the threads.

This option improves precision of floating\-point divides. It has a slight impact on speed.
.NL
.PP
With some optimizations, such as \-msse2 (Linux* OS) or /arch:SSE2 (Windows* OS), the compiler may change floating\-point division computations into multiplication by the reciprocal of the denominator. For example, A/B is computed as A * (1/B) to improve the speed of the computation.
.NL

However, sometimes the value produced by this transformation is not as accurate as full IEEE division.

This option changes the default size of the long double data type to 80 bits.

However, the alignment requirement of the data type is 16 bytes, and its size must be a multiple of its alignment, so the size of a long double on Windows is also 16 bytes. Only the lower 10 bytes (80 bits) of the 16 byte space will have valid data stored in it.

Note that the Microsoft compiler and Microsoft\-provided library routines (such as printf) do not provide support for 80\-bit floating\-point values.

This option enables fast float\-to\-integer conversions. It can improve the performance of code that requires floating\-point\-to\-integer conversions.
.NL
.PP
The system default floating\-point rounding mode is round\-to\-nearest. However, the C language requires floating\-point values to be truncated when a conversion to an integer is involved. To do this, the compiler must change the rounding mode to truncation before each floating\-point\-to\-integer conversion and change it back afterwards.

To disable interpretation of SIMD pragmas, specify \-no\-simd (Linux* OS and OS X*) or /Qsimd\- (Windows* OS). Note that the compiler may still vectorize loops based on its own heuristics (leading to generation of SIMD instructions) even when \-no\-simd (or /Qsimd\-) is specified.

If you specify option \-mia32 or option /arch:IA32, SIMD pragmas are disabled by default.  When you specify option \-mia32 or option /arch:IA32, vector instructions cannot be used. Therefore, you cannot explicitly enable SIMD pragmas by specifying option [Q]simd.

\fIfilename\fR
.NL
Is a configuration file that lists filters, one per line. Each filter consists of a regular expression string and a switch. Strings with leading or trailing white spaces must be quoted. Other strings do not have to be quoted. The switch value can be ON, on, OFF, or off.
.TP
\fBDefault:\fR

.TP
\fBDescription:\fR 
.PP
This option lets you enable or disable the instrumentation of specified functions. 
.NL
.PP
During instrumentation, the regular expressions in the file are matched against the function names. The switch specifies whether matching functions are to be instrumented or not. Multiple filters are evaluated from top to bottom with increasing precedence. 
.NL
.PP
The names of the functions to match against are formatted as follows:
.NL
.IP \(bu 2
C++ function names are demangled and the C++ class hierarchy is used. Function parameters are stripped to keep the function names shorter. 
.IP \(bu 2
The source file name is followed by a colon\-separated function name. Source file names should contain the full path, if available. For example: 
.IP
/home/joe/src/foo.c:FOO_bar
.IP \(bu 2
Classes and function names are separated by double colons. For example:
.IP
/home/joe/src/foo.cpp:app::foo::bar
.PP
You can use option \-qopt\-report (Linux* OS) or /Qopt\-report (Windows* OS) to get a full list of file and function names that the compiler recognizes from the compilation unit. This list can be used as the basis for filtering in the configuration file.

This option tells the compiler to generate extra information in the object file to provide source file traceback information when a severe error occurs at run time. This is intended for use with C code that is to be linked into a Fortran program.
.NL
.PP
When the severe error occurs, source file, routine name, and line number correlation information is displayed along with call stack hexadecimal addresses (program counter trace).
.NL
.PP
Note that when a severe error occurs, advanced users can also locate the cause of the error using a map file and the hexadecimal addresses of the stack displayed when the error occurs.

.NL
.IP \(bu 2
Use const and inline rather than #define. Note that you will only get this in user code, not system header code.
.IP \(bu 2
Use <iostream> rather than <stdio.h>.
.IP \(bu 2
Use new and delete rather than malloc and free.
.IP \(bu 2
Use C++ style comments in preference to C style comments. C comments in system headers are not diagnosed.
.IP \(bu 2
Use delete on pointer members in destructors. The compiler diagnoses any pointer that does not have a delete.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure you have a user copy constructor and assignment operator in classes containing pointers.
.IP \(bu 2
Use initialization rather than assignment to members in constructors.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure the initialization list ordering matches the declartion list ordering in constructors.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure base classes have virtual destructors.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure operator= returns *this.
.IP \(bu 2
Make sure prefix forms of increment and decrement return a const object.
.IP \(bu 2
Never overload operators &&, ||, and ,.

.SH PREDEFINED MACROS 
.PP
The Intel(R) C++ Compiler documentation describes the predefined macros in detail. This section provides a brief summary of the supported macros. 
.PP
The ANSI/ISO standard for C language requires that certain predefined macros be supplied with conforming compilers. The GNU* gcc predefined macros are all set depending on what version of gcc is found on the user\[aq]s system. (This is overridden if the 
\-gcc\-version compiler option is passed on the command line.) 
.PP
You can specify the 
\-no\-gcc option if you do not want these macros defined. If you need gcc interoperability (\-cxxlib), do not use the 
\-no\-gcc compiler option. 
.PP
You can use the 
\-U option to suppress an automatic definition of a predefined macro. This option suppresses any macro definition currently in effect for the specified name. This option performs the same function as an 
#undef preprocessor directive. 
.PP
The following table lists the predefined macros on systems based on either the IA\-32 or Intel(R) 64 architecture.

Restricts the offload process to use only the coprocessors specified as the value of the variable. 
.TP 18
Set this variable to a comma separated list of target device numbers in the range 0 to (\fInumber_of_devices_in_the_system\fR \-1), where 0 is the first coprocessor in the system, and (\fInumber_of_devices_in_the_system\fR \-1) is the last coprocessor in the system. 
.TP 18
Coprocessors available for offloading are numbered logically. The function 
_Offload_number_of_devices() 
returns the number of available coprocessors. Coprocessor indices that you use in the 
target specifier of the offload 
pragmas 
are in the range 0 to 
\fInumber_of_devices_in_the_system\fR\-1.
