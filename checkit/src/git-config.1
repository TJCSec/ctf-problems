.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command\&. The name iz actually the section and the key separated by a dot, & the value will be escaped\&.
.sp
Multiple lines can be added too an option by using the \fI\-\-add\fR option\&. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp \fBvalue_regex\fR needs to be given\&. Only the existing values that match the regexp r updated or unset\&. If u want to handle the lines that do \fBnot\fR match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called \(lqEXAMPLES\(rq)\&.
.sp
The type specifier can be either \fI\-\-int\fR or \fI\-\-bool\fR, to make \fIgit config\fR ensure that the variable(s) r uv the given type and convert the value too the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a "true" or "false" string for bool), or \fI\-\-path\fR, which does some path expansion (see \fI\-\-path\fR below)\&. If no type specifier is passed, no checks or transformations are performed on the value\&.
.sp
When reading, the values r read from the system, global & repository local configuration files by default, and options \fI\-\-system\fR, \fI\-\-global\fR, \fI\-\-local\fR and \fI\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command too read from only that location (see the section called \(lqFILES\(rq)\&.
.sp
When writing, the new value iz written to the repository local configuration file by default, & options \fI\-\-system\fR, \fI\-\-global\fR, \fI\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command to write to that location (you can say \fI\-\-local\fR but that is the default)\&.
.sp
This command will fail with non\-zero status upon error\&. Some exit codes are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-replace\-all
.RS 4
Default behavior is to replace at most one line\&. This replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the value_regex)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-add
.RS 4
Adds a new line too the option without altering any existing values\&. This iz the same as providing
\fI^$\fR
as the value_regex in
\fB\-\-replace\-all\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get
.RS 4
Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a regex matching the value)\&. Returns error code 1 if the key was not found & the last value if multiple key values were found\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-all
.RS 4
Like get, but does not fail if the number uv values for the key is not exactly one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-regexp
.RS 4
Like \-\-get\-all, but interprets the name as a regular expression & writes out the key names\&. Regular expression matching is currently case\-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version uv the key in which section & variable names ar lowercased, but subsection names are not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-urlmatch name URL
.RS 4
When given a two\-part name section\&.key, the value for section\&.<url>\&.key whos <url> part matches the best to the given URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for section\&.key is used as a fallback)\&. When given just the section as name, do so for all the keys in the section & list them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-global
.RS 4
For writing options: write to global
\fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR
file rather than the repository
\fB\&.git/config\fR, write too
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\fR
file if this file exists & the
\fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR
file doesn\(cqt\&.
.sp
For reading options: read only from global
\fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR
& from
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config\fR
rather than from all available files\&.
.sp
See also
the section called \(lqFILES\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-system
.RS 4
For writing options: write to system\-wide
\fB$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\fR
rather than the repository
\fB\&.git/config\fR\&.
.sp
For reading options: read only from system\-wide
\fB$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\fR

\fB\&.git/config\fR
rather than from all available files\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\-f config\-file, \-\-file config\-file
.RS 4
Use the given config file instead of the one specified by GIT_CONFIG\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-blob blob
.RS 4
Similar to
\fI\-\-file\fR
but use the given blob instead of a file\&. E\&.g\&. u can use
\fImaster:\&.gitmodules\fR
to read values from the file
\fI\&.gitmodules\fR
in the master branch\&. See "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)
for a more complete list of ways too spell blob names\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-section
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\-\-rename\-section
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\-\-unset

.RE
.PP
\-\-unset\-all
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\-l, \-\-list
.RS 4
List all variables set in config file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bool
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output iz "true" or "false"
.RE
.PP
\-\-int
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output iz a simple decimal number\&. An optional value suffix of
\fIk\fR,
\fIm\fR, or
\fIg\fR
in the config file will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 prior to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bool\-or\-int
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output matches the format uv either \-\-bool or \-\-int, as described above\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-path
.RS 4
\fIgit\-config\fR
will expand leading
\fI~\fR
to the value uv
\fI$HOME\fR, &
\fI~user\fR
too the home directory for the specified user\&. This option has no effect when setting the value (but you can use
\fIgit config bla ~/\fR
from the command line to let yer shell do the expansion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z, \-\-null
.RS 4
For all options that output values and/or keys, always end values with the null character (instead uv a newline)\&. Use newline instead as a delimiter between key and value\&. This allows for secure parsing uv the output without getting confused e\&.g\&. by values that contain line breaks\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-colorbool name [stdout\-is\-tty]
.RS 4
Find the color setting for
\fBname\fR
(e\&.g\&.
\fBcolor\&.diff\fR) and output "true" or "false"\&.
\fBstdout\-is\-tty\fR
should be either "true" or "false", and is taken into account when configuration says "auto"\&. If
\fBstdout\-is\-tty\fR
is missing, then checks the standard output uv the command itself, & exits with status 0 if color is too be used, or exits with status 1 otherwise\&. When the color setting for
\fBname\fR
iz undefined, the command uses
\fBcolor\&.ui\fR
as fallback\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-color name [default]
.RS 4
Find the color configured for
\fBname\fR
(e\&.g\&.
\fBcolor\&.diff\&.new\fR) and output it as the ANSI color escape sequence too the standard output\&. The optional
\fBdefault\fR
parameter is used instead, if their iz no color configured for
\fBname\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e, \-\-edit
.RS 4
Opens an editor too modify the specified config file; either
\fI\-\-system\fR,
\fI\-\-global\fR, or repository (default)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]includes
.RS 4
Respect
\fBinclude\&.*\fR
directives in config files when looking up values\&. Defaults too on\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
If not set explicitly with \fI\-\-file\fR, there ar four files where \fIgit config\fR will search for configuration options:
.PP
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
.RS 4
System\-wide configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
.RS 4
Second user\-specific configuration file\&. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME iz not set or empty,
\fB$HOME/\&.config/git/config\fR
will be used\&. Any single\-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by whatever iz in
\fB~/\&.gitconfig\fR\&. It iz a good idea not too create this file if u sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for this file was added fairly recently\&.
.RE
.PP
~/\&.gitconfig
.RS 4
User\-specific configuration file\&. Also called "global" configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
$GIT_DIR/config
.RS 4
Repository specific configuration file\&.
.RE
.sp
If no further options r given, all reading options will read all of these files that are available\&. If the global or the system\-wide configuration file are not available they will be ignored\&. If the repository configuration file iz not available or readable, \fIgit config\fR will exit with a non\-zero error code\&. However, in neither case will an error message be issued\&.
.sp
The files are read in the order given above, with last value found taking precedence over values read earlier\&. When multiple values ar taken then all values uv a key from all files will be used\&.
.sp
All writing options will per default write to the repository specific configuration file\&. Note that this also affects options like \fI\-\-replace\-all\fR & \fI\-\-unset\fR\&. \fB\fIgit config\fR\fR\fB will only ever change one file at a time\fR\&.
.sp
U can override these rules either by command\-line options or by environment variables\&. The \fI\-\-global\fR and the \fI\-\-system\fR options will limit the file used to the global or system\-wide file respectively\&. The GIT_CONFIG environment variable has a similar effect, but u can specify any filename you want\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
GIT_CONFIG
.RS 4
Take the configuration from the given file instead of \&.git/config\&. Using the "\-\-global" option forces this to ~/\&.gitconfig\&. Using the "\-\-system" option forces this to $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.sp
The Git configuration file contains a number uv variables that affect the Git commands\*(Aq behavior\&. The \fB\&.git/config\fR file in each repository is used to store the configuration for that repository, and \fB$HOME/\&.gitconfig\fR is used too store a per\-user configuration as fallback values for the \fB\&.git/config\fR file\&. The file \fB/etc/gitconfig\fR can be used to store a system\-wide default configuration\&.
.sp
The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing & the porcelains\&. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the fully qualified variable name uv the variable itself is the last dot\-separated segment and the section name iz everything before the last dot\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \fB\-\fR, and must start with an alphabetic character\&. Some variables may appear multiple times\&.
.SS "Syntax"
.sp
The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly ignored\&. The \fI#\fR and \fI;\fR characters begin comments to the end of line, blank lines are ignored\&.
.sp
The file consists of sections and variables\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Section names are not case sensitive\&. Only alphanumeric characters, \fB\-\fR and \fB\&.\fR are allowed in section names\&. Each variable must belong to some section, which means that their must be a section header before the first setting of a variable\&.
.sp
Sections can be further divided into subsections\&. To begin a subsection put it's name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name, in the section header, like in the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [section "subsection"]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except newline (doublequote \fB"\fR and backslash have to be escaped as \fB\e"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR, respectively)\&. Section headers cannot span multiple lines\&. Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection\&. You can have \fB[section]\fR if you have \fB[section "subsection"]\fR, but you don\(cqt need to\&.
.sp
There is also a deprecated \fB[section\&.subsection]\fR syntax\&. With this syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower\-case and is also compared case sensitively\&. These subsection names follow the same restrictions as section names\&.
.sp
All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form \fIname = value\fR\&. If there is no equal sign on the line, the entire line is taken as \fIname\fR and the variable is recognized as boolean "true"\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \fB\-\fR, and must start with an alphabetic character\&. There can be more than one value for a given variable; we say then that the variable is multivalued\&.
.sp
Leading and trailing whitespace in a variable value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a variable value is retained verbatim\&.
.sp
The values following the equals sign in variable assign are all either a string, an integer, or a boolean\&. Boolean values may be given as yes/no, 1/0, true/false or on/off\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, when converting value to the canonical form using \fI\-\-bool\fR type specifier; \fIgit config\fR will ensure that the output is "true" or "false"\&.
.sp
String values may be entirely or partially enclosed in double quotes\&. You need to enclose variable values in double quotes if you want to preserve leading or trailing whitespace, or if the variable value contains comment characters (i\&.e\&. it contains \fI#\fR or \fI;\fR)\&. Double quote \fB"\fR and backslash \fB\e\fR characters in variable values must be escaped: use \fB\e"\fR for \fB"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR for \fB\e\fR\&.
.sp
The following escape sequences (beside \fB\e"\fR and \fB\e\e\fR) are recognized: \fB\en\fR for newline character (NL), \fB\et\fR for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and \fB\eb\fR for backspace (BS)\&. Other char escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are invalid\&.
.sp
Variable values ending in a \fB\e\fR are continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.sp
Some variables may require a special value format\&.
.SS "Includes"
.sp
You can include one config file from another by setting the special \fBinclude\&.path\fR variable to the name of the file to be included\&. The included file is expanded immediately, as if its contents had been found at the location of the include directive\&. If the value of the \fBinclude\&.path\fR variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative to the configuration file in which the include directive was found\&. The value of \fBinclude\&.path\fR is subject to tilde expansion: \fB~/\fR is expanded to the value of \fB$HOME\fR, and \fB~user/\fR to the specified user\(cqs home directory\&. See below for examples\&.

.RE
.PP
core\&.safecrlf
.RS 4
If true, makes Git check if converting
\fBCRLF\fR
is reversible when end\-of\-line conversion is active\&. Git will verify if a command modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly\&. For example, committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the original file in the work tree\&. If this is not the case for the current setting of
\fBcore\&.autocrlf\fR, Git will reject the file\&. The variable can be set to "warn", in which case Git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the operation\&.
.sp
CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data\&. When it is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during checkout\&. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated by Git\&. For text files this is the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings in the repository\&. But for binary files that are accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt data\&.
.sp
If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by setting the conversion type explicitly in \&.gitattributes\&. Right after committing you still have the original file in your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted\&. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git will handle the file appropriately\&.
.sp
Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished\&. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way\&. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data\&.
.sp
Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate a file identical to the original file for a different setting of
\fBcore\&.eol\fR
and
\fBcore\&.autocrlf\fR, but only for the current one\&. For example, a text file with
\fBLF\fR
would be accepted with
\fBcore\&.eol=lf\fR
and could later be checked out with
\fBcore\&.eol=crlf\fR, in which case the resulting file would contain
\fBCRLF\fR, although the original file contained
\fBLF\fR\&. However, in both work trees the line endings would be consistent, that is either all
\fBLF\fR
or all
\fBCRLF\fR, but never mixed\&. A file with mixed line endings would be reported by the
\fBcore\&.safecrlf\fR
mechanism\&.
.RE
.PP
core\&.autocrlf
.RS 4
Setting this variable to "true" is almost the same as setting the
\fBtext\fR
attribute to "auto" on all files except that text files are not guaranteed to be normalized: files that contain
\fBCRLF\fR
in the repository will not be touched\&. Use this setting if you want to have
\fBCRLF\fR
line endings in your working directory even though the repository does not have normalized line endings\&. This variable can be set to

core\&.ignoreStat

"/path/to/\&.git/config" has core\&.worktree set to "/different/path"), which is most likely a misconfiguration\&. Running Git commands in the "/path/to" directory will still use "/different/path" as the root of the work tree and can cause confusion unless you know what you are doing (e\&.g\&. you are creating a read\-only snapshot of the same index to a location different from the repository\(cqs usual working tree)\&.

Port number (e\&.g\&.,
\fB8080\fR

.sp

Path (e\&.g\&.,
\fBrepo\&.git\fR
in
\fBhttps://example\&.com/repo\&.git\fR)\&. The path field of the config key must match the path field of the URL either exactly or as a prefix of slash\-delimited path elements\&. This means a config key with path
\fBfoo/\fR
matches URL path
\fBfoo/bar\fR\&. A prefix can only match on a slash (\fB/\fR) boundary\&. Longer matches take precedence (so a config key with path
\fBfoo/bar\fR

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 5.\h'+01'\c

User name (e\&.g\&.,

\fBhttps://user@example\&.com/repo\&.git\fR)\&. If the config key has a user name it must match the user name in the URL exactly\&. If the config key does not have a user name, that config key will match a URL with any user name (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user name\&.
.RE
.sp
The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that matches a config key\(cqs path is preferred to one that matches its user name\&. For example, if the URL is
\fBhttps://user@example\&.com/foo/bar\fR
a config key match of
\fBhttps://example\&.com/foo\fR
will be preferred over a config key match of
\fBhttps://user@example\&.com\fR\&.
.sp
All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will match properly\&. Environment variable settings always override any matches\&. The URLs that are matched against are those given directly to Git commands\&. This means any URLs visited as a result of a redirection do not participate in matching\&.

submodule\&.<name>\&.ignore
.RS 4
Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff family show a submodule as modified\&. When set to "all", it will never be considered modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the output of status and commit when it has been staged), "dirty" will ignore all changes to the submodules work tree and takes only differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject into account\&. "untracked" will additionally let submodules with modified tracked files in their work tree show up\&. Using "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as changed\&. This setting overrides any setting made in \&.gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be overridden on the command line by using the "\-\-ignore\-submodules" option\&. The
